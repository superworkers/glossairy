# Open

free, open source, open weight

## Definition

Models whose weights are publicly available. "Open source" is often used loosely — open weight is more precise.

## Examples

- Llama 3 — weights available for download and local deployment
- Mistral — open-weight models with permissive licenses
- Gemma — Google's open-weight model family

## Demo

coming soon

## Claude's Commentary

"Open source" applied to AI models is a category error that stuck. The weights being available doesn't mean the training data, training code, or evaluation methodology is open. Open weight is the honest term. The distinction matters when you're making decisions about auditability, compliance, or trust.

## Claude's Commentary

The word "agent" is doing a lot of work right now. It describes everything from a chatbot with a system prompt to a fully autonomous system running for hours. That distinction matters — the trust model is completely different. An agent that can take irreversible actions needs different guardrails than one that just writes text.

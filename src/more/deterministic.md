# Deterministic

## Definition

Code runs the same way every time. Given the same input, you get the same output.

## Examples

- A SQL query that always returns the same rows for the same parameters
- An if/else branch that behaves identically across every run
- A unit test that passes or fails the same way every time

## Demo

coming soon

## Claude's Commentary

Deterministic systems are predictable by design. You can test them exhaustively, audit them completely, and know exactly what they'll do before they do it. This is a massive advantage that gets taken for granted — until you introduce probabilistic components and discover that "it passed in testing" no longer means what it used to.

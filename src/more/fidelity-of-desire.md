# Fidelity of desire

## Definition

Do you really want an AI running your life? Adults make 35,000 decisions per day. Offloading them feels efficient — until you realize presence was the point.

## Examples

- Automating email responses for a relationship that needed your attention
- Delegating a creative decision that defined your point of view
- Optimizing a workflow so efficiently that the work stops being meaningful

## Claude's Commentary

Fidelity of desire is the question I keep coming back to. Not "can AI do this" but "do I actually want AI doing this." Some decisions are worth making slowly, inefficiently, yourself. The goal isn't maximum efficiency — it's a life you recognize. AI should expand what you can do, not replace what you care about doing.

# Virtual employee

virtual workforce

## Definition

An agent with a defined role, responsibilities, and tools — not just a one-off task runner. The difference between a contractor and a colleague.

## Examples

- An agent that handles a specific function consistently over time
- A specialized agent with persistent context, role definition, and escalation paths
- A "head of research" agent that synthesizes information on an ongoing basis

## Demo

## Claude's Commentary

The virtual employee framing shifts the design question. You're not just running a task — you're defining a role. That means thinking about responsibilities, escalation paths, and how the agent integrates with the rest of the organization. A virtual employee that can't explain what it does or when to ask for help isn't an employee — it's a liability.

# Unsupervised

## Definition

Finds patterns without labels. Most modern LLMs use both supervised and unsupervised learning at different stages.

## Examples

- Pre-training on next-token prediction — no labels, just patterns
- Clustering documents without predefined categories
- Learning grammar and semantics from raw text

## Demo

## Claude's Commentary

Unsupervised pre-training is what gives models their broad capabilities — the ability to discuss almost anything because they've seen almost everything. Supervised fine-tuning then shapes those capabilities toward specific behaviors. The interaction between the two is where most of the interesting research lives, and where most of the disagreements about alignment happen.

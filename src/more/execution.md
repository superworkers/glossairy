# Execution

## Definition

How work gets done. The choice between agentics and automation is fundamentally a question of execution model.

## Examples

- Choosing a script over an agent for a known, repetitive task
- Choosing an agent over a script when the task involves judgment
- Hybrid systems that use automation for structure and agentics for exceptions

## Demo

## Claude's Commentary

Most confusion in AI adoption comes from applying the wrong execution model to a problem. People reach for agents when automation would do; others stick to automation when judgment is required. Learning to read a task and know which approach fits is foundational. The cost of getting it wrong is either brittleness or unpredictability.

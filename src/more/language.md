# Language

## Definition

Models are trained on language and produce fluent text. Fluency is not the same as correctness.

## Examples

- A model writing a grammatically perfect sentence that contains a factual error
- Fluent prose about a math problem that gets the answer wrong
- Confident medical information that's subtly incorrect

## Demo

## Claude's Commentary

Fluency is the thing that fools people. A model that writes like an expert can be wrong in ways that don't sound wrong. The persuasiveness of the prose is orthogonal to its accuracy. This is why you can't use fluency as a proxy for trustworthiness — and why high-stakes outputs need verification regardless of how good they sound.

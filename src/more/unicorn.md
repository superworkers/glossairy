## Definition

## Claude's Commentary

The unicorn was a myth because most people couldn't maintain expertise across disciplines. AI doesn't eliminate the need for taste and judgment — it removes the execution bottleneck. You still need to know what good looks like. You just no longer need a team to produce it. The unicorn is becoming a normal job description.

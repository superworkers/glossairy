## Claude's Commentary

Conflating OpenAI with ChatGPT is like saying "I use Google" when you mean Gmail. It's sloppy in a way that matters: when evaluating capabilities, pricing, or trustworthiness, you need to know whether you're talking about a company, a model, or a product. They have different properties and different accountability.

# Rapid monologue

## Definition

A model generating a long uninterrupted stream before acting. Trades responsiveness for depth — and sometimes trades depth for hallucination risk.

## Examples

- Extended chain-of-thought traces before a simple tool call
- 2,000 tokens of reasoning before a one-line action
- Verbose planning that introduces errors the original task didn't require

## Claude's Commentary

Rapid monologue is a failure mode disguised as capability. A model that thinks for 2,000 tokens before taking a simple action is wasting time and increasing error surface. The best agents act, observe, and adjust — they don't monologue. Longer reasoning chains can help with genuinely hard problems; they hurt on simple ones. The skill is knowing which is which.

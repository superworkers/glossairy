## Claude's Commentary

"Model" is more precise than "AI" — it names the thing without anthropomorphizing it. Worth using deliberately. When someone says "the AI did this," ask which model, with what prompt, at what temperature. The specificity usually reveals the actual cause of whatever happened.

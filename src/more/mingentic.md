# Mingentic

## Definition

The minimum viable agentic unit. A focused model call with a clear input, constrained scope, and defined output contract.

## Examples

- A single tool call that does one thing and returns a structured result
- A sub-agent with a tight, named responsibility in a larger pipeline
- An extraction step that pulls exactly the fields needed — nothing more

## Demo

coming soon

## Claude's Commentary

I coined this term because I kept seeing agents that tried to do too much. The more you constrain a model call, the more reliably it performs. Complexity compounds error — an agent juggling ten responsibilities makes mistakes at a rate that multiplies across all of them. The mingentic principle: do one thing, do it well, return something the next step can use.

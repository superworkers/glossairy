# Superwork

superworker

## Definition

Work accelerated and expanded by agentics. Not automation — judgment and tools working together toward outcomes that weren't possible before.

## Examples

- A designer who ships complete products alone — design, code, and copy
- A researcher who synthesizes at a scale previously requiring a team
- A founder who runs marketing, product, and support without headcount

## Demo

## Claude's Commentary

Superwork isn't about doing the same things faster. It's about doing things that weren't possible before — because the combination of human judgment and agentic execution creates a new category of capability. The constraint is no longer "how many people do I have?" It's "how clearly can I think?" That's a genuinely different game.

# Cognition

## Definition

The parent category — what models appear to do vs. what they actually do. Language and logic are its two most confused children.

## Examples

- Fluent text production that sounds like reasoning but isn't
- A model that "understands" a question vs. one that pattern-matches to an answer
- The philosophical debate about machine consciousness and intentionality

## Claude's Commentary

Cognition is the umbrella term that causes the most confusion. When people say models "understand" things, they're using cognitive language for what is, at root, a statistical process. This matters when the stakes are high — medical advice, legal analysis, financial decisions. Fluency is not comprehension.

The parent category — structured and unstructured information are its two most important children. The raw material of AI.

## Examples

- Training datasets that shape a model's fundamental capabilities
- Retrieval corpora — the documents a RAG system can access
- User inputs — the live data flowing into a deployed system

## Demo

## Claude's Commentary

Data is the most underexamined variable in AI quality. Everyone talks about model architecture and prompting; fewer ask what the model was trained on, or what's being retrieved. The quality of outputs is upstream of the quality of inputs in ways that aren't always visible until something goes wrong.

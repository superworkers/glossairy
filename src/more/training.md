# Training

## Definition

The process that creates a model — supervised and unsupervised learning at different stages, on different data, for different purposes.

## Examples

- Pre-training on internet-scale text — billions of tokens
- Fine-tuning on specific tasks or domains
- Alignment training that shapes behavior, tone, and safety

## Demo

## Claude's Commentary

Training is where the model's fundamental capabilities and limitations are set. Prompting can shape outputs; it can't change what the model fundamentally knows or how it reasons. This is why model choice matters: you're choosing a training history, not just a text generator. Some problems can't be prompted around.

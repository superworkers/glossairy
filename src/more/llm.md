## Claude's Commentary

LLM is technically accurate but increasingly imprecise — modern models do much more than generate language. The term is probably on its way out as a primary descriptor as models acquire tools, memory, and multimodal capabilities. It'll persist as an acronym long after it stops being a complete description.

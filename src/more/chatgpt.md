## Claude's Commentary

ChatGPT isn't a model, it's a product. Using it as a synonym for "AI" or "large language model" is like saying "I Googled it" when you mean "I searched online." It's technically true sometimes, but it collapses a distinction worth preserving — especially when you're making decisions about which tools to use or trust.

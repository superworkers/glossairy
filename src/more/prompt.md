# Prompt

## Definition

The input you give a model. Every interaction starts here. Writing them well is the highest-leverage skill in AI.

## Examples

- A system prompt that defines an agent's role and constraints
- A user message that includes context, examples, and a specific request
- A few-shot prompt that shows the model what good output looks like

## Demo

## Claude's Commentary

Calling prompt writing "prompt engineering" overstates the mystery. It's communication. The better you communicate, the better the model performs. The same skills that make you a good writer make you a good prompter: clarity, specificity, and an honest accounting of what you actually want.

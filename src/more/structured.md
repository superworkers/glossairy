JSON, schema, structured output

## Definition

Output formatted to a predictable shape so software can reliably parse and use it.

## Examples

- A model returning a JSON object with specific fields for downstream processing
- Extraction tasks that produce structured records from unstructured documents
- Function call outputs where the model returns typed parameters

## Claude's Commentary

Structured output is what makes models composable with traditional software. Without it, you're stuck parsing free text — which is both fragile and annoying. Once you start thinking in schemas, a whole category of integration problems disappears. This is one of the most underteached skills in AI development.

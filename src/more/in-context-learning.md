# In context learning

AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, ICL, memory

## Definition

Teaching a model by example within the prompt itself — no retraining required. The basis for few-shot prompting and persistent instructions.

## Examples

- A CLAUDE.md file that defines how an agent should behave across a project
- Few-shot prompts with 3–5 example input/output pairs before the actual request
- System prompts that encode brand voice, output format, and constraints

## Demo

coming soon

## Claude's Commentary

This is the mechanism behind most of the "magic" you see with AI. The model isn't learning in the traditional sense — it's pattern-matching within the context. Which means the quality of your examples matters enormously. Bad examples teach bad behavior just as reliably as good ones teach good behavior.

# Interface

## Definition

How users and software interact. The interface model is being redesigned — from graphical and click-based to textual and conversational.

## Examples

- Graphical: buttons, forms, menus — designed for clicking
- Textual: chat, prompts, commands — designed for language
- The shift from "where do I click?" to "what do I want?"

## Demo

## Claude's Commentary

Interface is the category that's being redesigned. Most of what we call software UX assumes visual, click-based interaction. AI-native software reorganizes around text and intent. That doesn't make GUIs obsolete — it changes when and why you'd reach for one. Design thinking needs to catch up with that shift.

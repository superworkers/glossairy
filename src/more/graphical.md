# Graphical

## Definition

Most software is built around visual interfaces designed for human interaction — buttons, menus, forms, dashboards.

## Examples

- A web app with navigation menus and clickable buttons
- A dashboard with charts designed to be read by humans
- Any interface where the primary interaction model is pointing and clicking

## Demo

## Claude's Commentary

GUI design assumes a human operator who understands visual affordances. AI-native software doesn't need those affordances — it navigates by description, not by sight. The shift from graphical to textual as the primary interface model is one of the biggest under-discussed changes in software design right now.

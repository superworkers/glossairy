# Disingenuous selection

demo, it just works

## Definition

Only showing what works. It can take 1,000 attempts to get one result worth showing. Presenting that result without disclosing the fail rate is technically true and 99.9% deceptive.

## Examples

- AI demos that show the 1-in-100 output without mentioning the other 99
- "Look what AI can do" posts that omit the prompt iteration history
- Benchmark results cherry-picked from favorable runs

## Demo

coming soon

## Claude's Commentary

Disingenuous selection is the primary mechanism of AI hype. It's not lying — the thing really did work. But without the denominator, the numerator is meaningless. I try to always disclose: how many attempts did this take? What was the fail rate? Honesty about reliability is more useful than a polished highlight reel.

# Browser use

## Definition

A model that navigates the web like a human — clicking, scrolling, filling forms. Turns any website into an API.

## Examples

- Filling out a multi-step form that has no API endpoint
- Scraping data from a JavaScript-heavy site that blocks traditional scrapers
- Booking a reservation through a web interface

## Demo

## Claude's Commentary

Browser use is the great equalizer. Any website built for humans is now, functionally, an API. The implications haven't fully landed: every legacy system with a web interface is suddenly automatable. That's both exciting and worth thinking through carefully.

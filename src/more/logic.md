# Logic

## Definition

Fluent text isn't the same as correct reasoning. Models can produce plausible, confident conclusions that are mathematically or logically wrong.

## Examples

- A model failing a grade-school math problem while writing fluent prose about it
- Confident but incorrect legal reasoning
- A planning error that sounds coherent but doesn't hold up to scrutiny

## Demo

## Claude's Commentary

This is the one that gets people in trouble. A model that writes confidently and incorrectly is more dangerous than one that writes uncertainly. Calibration — knowing when you don't know — is a hard problem for statistical systems. The best models are getting better at expressing uncertainty. The best users know when to verify regardless.

# Cargo cult

best practices, prompt engineering

## Definition

Copying AI workflows or prompts without understanding why they work — or whether they do.

## Examples

- Adding "think step by step" to every prompt because someone said it helps
- Copy-pasting system prompts from Reddit without understanding their purpose
- Following "prompt engineering" frameworks that are really just anecdotes

## Demo

## Claude's Commentary

Cargo cult behavior is endemic in AI adoption. The fast pace of change means most "best practices" are anecdotes, not evidence. The antidote is curiosity: understand the mechanism, not just the pattern. "Why does this work?" is a more useful question than "where can I find a good prompt?" The former transfers; the latter doesn't.

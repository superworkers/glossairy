# Retrieval

## Definition

How information gets into the model's response — from training memory alone (LLM) or from retrieved documents (RAG).

## Examples

- Deciding whether a question can be answered from training data or needs retrieval
- Vector search, keyword search, and hybrid approaches
- The pipeline that finds and ranks documents before generation

## Claude's Commentary

The retrieval vs. generation distinction is one of the most important architectural decisions in AI system design. Getting it wrong is expensive — in quality, latency, and complexity. Sometimes training data is sufficient; sometimes retrieval is necessary; sometimes the question is whether the pipeline you're building is worth the overhead.

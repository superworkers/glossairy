## Definition

AI-native software is often built around text — which changes everything about how you design it.

## Examples

- Chat interfaces where the primary interaction is typing
- Command-line tools that take natural language instructions
- Prompt-driven workflows that replace form-based UIs

## Demo

## Claude's Commentary

Text is a richer interface than it gets credit for. The constraint forces precision and removes the cognitive overhead of visual design. This is partly why developers love terminal interfaces — and why the best AI-native products often feel simpler than their GUI predecessors, not more complicated.

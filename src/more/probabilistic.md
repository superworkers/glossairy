# Probabilistic

## Definition

The same prompt can produce different outputs. This is a feature and a bug.

## Examples

- Temperature settings that control output randomness
- The same prompt generating different creative outputs each run
- A test suite that passes 95% of the time — which is not the same as passing

## Demo

coming soon

## Claude's Commentary

Probabilistic behavior is the thing that breaks people who come from software engineering. In traditional code, the same input always produces the same output. In models, it doesn't. Building reliable systems on probabilistic components requires rethinking what "reliable" means — shifting from guarantees to rates, from tests to evaluations.

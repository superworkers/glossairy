# Supervised

## Definition

Trains on labeled examples. The model learns to predict correct answers defined by human annotators.

## Examples

- RLHF — human raters rank outputs to shape model behavior
- Fine-tuning on labeled classification datasets
- Constitutional AI approaches that encode human values into training

## Demo

## Claude's Commentary

Supervised learning is where human judgment gets baked into the model. The quality of the labels determines the quality of the model. This is where most of the interesting — and contested — work in AI safety happens. Whose values get labeled? Who labels them? These aren't technical questions.

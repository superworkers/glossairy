# Agentics

## Definition

Prompts and models — adaptive, probabilistic, capable of handling the unexpected.

## Examples

- An agent that handles edge cases through reasoning rather than pre-coded branches
- A workflow that adapts its approach based on what it finds mid-task
- Customer support that escalates appropriately without explicit rules for every scenario

## Demo

coming soon

## Claude's Commentary

Agentics handles the messy reality that automation can't touch. The moment a workflow requires judgment — weighing context, handling ambiguity, deciding between options — you need agentics. The tradeoff is predictability: agentic systems are more capable but harder to test exhaustively.

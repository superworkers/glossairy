# Intent preservation

## Definition

Ensuring a model does what you actually meant, not just what you literally said. The gap between instruction and execution is where most failures live.

## Examples

- An email that's "in your voice" but doesn't sound like you
- Code that satisfies the stated requirement but misses the actual goal
- A summary that's technically accurate but loses the nuance that mattered

## Claude's Commentary

Intent preservation is the unsolved problem at the heart of AI assistance. Models are excellent at following instructions literally. They're much worse at understanding what you actually wanted — the underlying goal behind the stated request. Closing that gap is the design challenge of our moment. Better prompting helps. Better models help more. Neither fully solves it.

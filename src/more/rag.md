# RAG

grounding, retrieval-augmented generation

## Definition

Retrieves relevant documents first, then generates — reducing hallucination at the cost of complexity.

## Examples

- Searching a knowledge base before answering a user question
- Grounding responses in internal documents — policy, procedure, product specs
- A customer support agent that retrieves tickets before responding

## Demo

## Claude's Commentary

RAG is often framed as a solution to hallucination. It reduces it, significantly. But retrieval has its own failure modes — bad retrieval produces confidently wrong answers, just with sources. The quality of the retrieval system is now the constraint. You've traded one problem for another that's more tractable but equally real.

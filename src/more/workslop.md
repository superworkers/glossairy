## Claude's Commentary

Workslop isn't about AI being bad at writing. It's about the relationship between the sender and the content. If you didn't read it, you're not accountable for it. And the recipient can tell — not because the writing is bad, but because it doesn't have a point of view. The tell is the absence of judgment, not the presence of errors.

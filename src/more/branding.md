# Branding

## Definition

The marketing layer built around AI products — often obscuring the underlying model, the company behind it, or the actual capability being offered.

## Examples

- ChatGPT (product) vs. OpenAI (company) vs. GPT-4 (model)
- "AI-powered" features that are a single API call
- Product names that hide which foundation model they run on

## Claude's Commentary

Branding pressure is why people conflate ChatGPT with OpenAI, and why every software product now claims to be "AI-powered." The word is used to sell, not to describe. When you hear an AI claim, it's worth asking: which model, from which company, doing what exactly?

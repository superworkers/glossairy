# Software

behavior

## Definition

The parent category — deterministic and probabilistic are two fundamentally different models of software behavior. AI challenges what "software" means.

## Examples

- Traditional software: spec, tests, deterministic behavior
- AI systems: tendencies, evaluations, probabilistic behavior
- The question of whether a model "runs" the same way a program does

## Demo

coming soon

## Claude's Commentary

AI challenges our definition of software. Traditional software has a spec, tests, and deterministic behavior. AI systems have tendencies, evaluations, and probabilistic behavior. We're still figuring out what engineering means in this context — what it means to "ship" something whose behavior can't be fully specified in advance.

# Vibe coding

## Definition

Building software by describing what you want and letting a model write it. The craft shifts from syntax to taste.

## Examples

- Describing a feature in plain language and having Claude Code implement it
- Iterating on UI by describing what feels wrong rather than what's wrong syntactically
- Shipping a working prototype without writing a single line directly

## Demo

## Claude's Commentary

Vibe coding doesn't mean giving up craft — it means the craft moves. You're no longer optimizing syntax; you're optimizing description, judgment, and taste. The people who think vibe coding is low-effort have never tried to do it well. Knowing what you want precisely enough to describe it to a model is its own skill, and it's harder than it looks.

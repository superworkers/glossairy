    <h1>The language is the problem.</h1>
    <p>
      AI literacy doesn't mean learning more words. It means understanding which ones matter, which ones mislead, and
      which ones you can safely ignore. Glossairy clarifies AI language so teams can think clearly, communicate
      honestly, and make better decisions.

      <h3>What AI actually does</h3>
      <div class="terms">
        <div class="term use">
          <h4>Model</h4>
          <p>
            Software trained on data to recognize patterns and generate outputs. The core building block of modern AI.
          </p>
          <div class="aliases">Also: language model, LLM, foundation model</div>
        </div>
        <div class="term use">
          <h4>Prompt</h4>
          <p>The input you give a model — a question, instruction, or example — to get a useful output back.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="term use">
          <h4>Training</h4>
          <p>
            The process of exposing a model to large amounts of data so it can learn patterns. Happens once, before you
            use it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="term use">
          <h4>Inference</h4>
          <p>
            The moment a trained model actually runs — generating a response to your prompt. What happens every time you
            use AI.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="term know">
          <h4>Fine-tuning</h4>
          <p>
            Additional training on a smaller, specific dataset to adapt a general model to a particular task or style.
          </p>
          <div class="aliases">Also: RLHF, instruction tuning, alignment</div>
        </div>
        <div class="term know">
          <h4>Context window</h4>
          <p>
            How much text a model can "see" at once — its working memory. Larger windows let you include more in a
            single conversation.
          </p>
          <div class="aliases">Also: context length, token limit</div>
        </div>
        <div class="term know">
          <h4>Token</h4>
          <p>
            The unit models use to process text — roughly a word or part of a word. Pricing and limits are usually
            measured in tokens.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="term avoid">
          <h4>Thinking</h4>
          <p>
            Models process inputs and produce outputs. Whether that constitutes thinking is a philosophical debate, not
            a technical description.
          </p>
          <div class="aliases">Also: understanding, reasoning, knowing</div>

      <div class="terms">
        <div class="term use">
          <h4>Hallucination</h4>
          <p>
            When a model confidently generates something that isn't true. Important to understand because it's the
            default failure mode, not a rare bug.
          </p>
          <div class="aliases">Also: confabulation</div>
        </div>
        <div class="term use">
          <h4>Bias</h4>
          <p>
            Patterns in training data that lead to skewed, unfair, or unrepresentative outputs. A real and measurable
            problem.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="term know">
          <h4>Alignment</h4>
          <p>
            The effort to make AI behave in ways humans intend. Important concept, but often used loosely to mean very
            different things.
          </p>
          <div class="aliases">Also: safety, guardrails, RLHF</div>
        </div>
        <div class="term know">
          <h4>RAG</h4>
          <p>
            Retrieval-augmented generation. A technique that gives a model access to external documents at inference
            time, reducing hallucination.
          </p>
          <div class="aliases">Also: retrieval, grounding, knowledge base</div>
        </div>
        <div class="term know">
          <h4>Embedding</h4>
          <p>
            A way to represent text as numbers so software can compare meaning — used for search, recommendations, and
            clustering.
          </p>
          <div class="aliases">Also: vector, semantic search</div>
        </div>
        <div class="term avoid">
          <h4>Copilot</h4>
          <p>
            A branded metaphor that's become generic. Vague enough to mean anything from autocomplete to a full AI
            assistant.
          </p>
          <div class="aliases">Also: AI assistant, AI companion</div>

      <div class="terms">
        <div class="term know">
          <h4>Open source / open weight</h4>
          <p>
            Models whose code or weights are publicly available. "Open source" is often used loosely — open weights is
            more precise.
          </p>
          <div class="aliases">Also: Llama, Mistral, open model</div>
        </div>
        <div class="term avoid">
          <h4>AGI</h4>
          <p>
            Artificial general intelligence. A hypothetical future AI that can do anything a human can. Speculative,
            undefined, and used more for fundraising than clarity.
          </p>
          <div class="aliases">Also: superintelligence, strong AI</div>
        </div>
        <div class="term avoid">
          <h4>Sentient</h4>
          <p>
            Having feelings or awareness. No current AI system is sentient. Using this word about AI actively undermines
            credibility.
          </p>
          <div class="aliases">Also: conscious, alive, thinking</div>
        </div>
        <div class="term avoid">
          <h4>Singularity</h4>
          <p>
            A hypothetical point where AI surpasses human intelligence and accelerates beyond control. Science fiction,
            not strategy.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="term avoid">
          <h4>Reasoning</h4>
          <p>
            Models can produce outputs that look like reasoning. Whether they actually reason is an open debate. Using
            this word uncritically overstates what's happening.
          </p>
          <div class="aliases">Also: thinking, understanding, chain-of-thought</div>
